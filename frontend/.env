# frontend/.env (FULLY CORRECTED)

# --- FIX: Use VITE_ prefix for public exposure ---
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8000/api/v1"

# This is a good variable to keep for development purposes
VITE_ENV="development" 

# Note: The old REACT_APP_ENV and REACT_APP_API_URL variables are now obsolete
# and should be deleted from this file.
